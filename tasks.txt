Add support for reading the source number in the given radix and conversion it to another given radix.

As there are 26 Latin letters, the maximum radix is 10+26=36. The minimum radix is 1: the number contains a symbol 1 [number] times.

Stage #5: Fractional numbers

Add support for fractional numbers. If there is a decimal point, use an algorithm to get the fractional answer.

Round your answer to 5 fractional symbols to zero.

If the target radix is 1, don't compute the fractional part.
